1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans  I initialized a repository using $ git init.  This created a new
file named .git and a repository is required to do a commit action.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Ans  The staging area contains files ready to be committed into the repository.
The working area contains files in various modes of modification to achieve a
new version objective.  Files in the working area can be added to the staging
area; files in the working area cannot be committed where files in the staging
area can be committed.
